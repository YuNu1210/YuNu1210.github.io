Welcome to my personal website!

I am Yu Nu, a final-year PhD candidate in Johnson Graduate School of Management at Cornell Tech/Cornell University, where I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Karan Girotra] (https://tech.cornell.edu/people/karan-girotra/) (Chair) and Prof. [Elena Belavina] (https://sha.cornell.edu/faculty-research/faculty/eb733/) (Co-chair). I hold a Bachelor's degree in Management Science & Engineering from Wuhan University, China.

I am broadly interested in sustainability, AI and operations, with a particular focus on food waste. 

**I am on the 2024-2025 academic job market**.
