Welcome to my personal website!

I am Yu Nu, an Assistant Professor of Management Science at the [Darla Moore School of Business](https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/moore/), the [University of South Carolina](https://sc.edu). I received my Ph.D. degree in [Operations, Technology, and Information Management (OTIM)](https://www.johnson.cornell.edu/programs/phd-program/operations-technology-information-management/) from the [Johnson Graduate School of Management](https://www.johnson.cornell.edu) at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu)/[Cornell Tech](https://tech.cornell.edu). 
<!--I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Karan Girotra](https://tech.cornell.edu/people/karan-girotra/) (Chair), Prof. [Elena Belavina](https://sha.cornell.edu/faculty-research/faculty/eb733/) (Co-chair), and Prof. [Meng Qi](https://business.cornell.edu/faculty-research/faculty/mq56/).-->

My research interests lie at the interface of sustainability, AI, and operations. I am particularly passionate about exploring how AI-based technologies can transform food waste management within commercial kitchens. Also, I integrate advanced data-driven analytics and insights into human-AI interaction to pioneer innovative solutions for effectively managing perishable inventory systems. I use full stack of data tools, including causal inference analyses, machine learning techniques, data-driven optimization strategies, and experiments.  

You can find my CV here: [[Yu Nu's Curriculum Vitae](https://YuNu1210.github.io/files/YuNu_CV_250819.pdf)]. 

<!--
**UPDATE: I will be teaching joining the University of South Carolina, Darla Moore School of Business as an Assistant Professor of Management Science in August 2025**.
