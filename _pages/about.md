Welcome to my personal website!

I am Yu Nu, a final-year PhD candidate in the [Operations, Technology, and Information Management (OTIM)](https://www.johnson.cornell.edu/programs/phd-program/operations-technology-information-management/) division of SC Johnson College of Business at [Cornell Tech](https://tech.cornell.edu/), where I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Karan Girotra](https://tech.cornell.edu/people/karan-girotra/) (Chair), Prof. [Elena Belavina](https://sha.cornell.edu/faculty-research/faculty/eb733/) (Co-chair), and Prof. [Meng Qi](https://business.cornell.edu/faculty-research/faculty/mq56/). I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Management Science & Engineering from [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn/), China. 

My research interests lie at the interface of sustainability, AI, and operations. I am particularly passionate about exploring how AI-based technologies can transform food waste management within commercial kitchens. Also, I integrate advanced data-driven analytics and insights into human-AI interaction to pioneer innovative solutions for effectively managing perishable inventory systems. I use full stack of data tools, including causal inference analyses, machine learning techniques, data-driven optimization strategies, and experiments.  

**I am on the 2024-2025 academic job market**.
