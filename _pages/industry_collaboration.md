## Winnow Solutions
We have been collaborating with [Winnow Solutions](https://www.winnowsolutions.com/) since 2021. As a global AI Leader in commercial food waste solutions, Winnow Solutions has been developing AI-driven food waste tracking systems for commercial kitchens. Winnow is being used every day by thousands of chefs in over 80 countries. 

Food waste is hard to measure, and hard to manage. Most kitchens waste more than they think, typically 5%-15% of the food they purchase. Winnowâ€™s food waste tracking technology makes collecting data easy. With Winnow systems, kitchens can easily measure and stratify their food waste down to the level of each disposal transaction, classifying waste as different items at different stages of preparation and processing. The collected data is made available to kitchen managers in daily, weekly, and monthly site reports. Kitchen managers also have access to a portal to dig deeper into the data and conduct further analytics. 

My research on AI and food waste is based on a long partnership with Winnow Solutions. With the first-of-its-kind waste data, I set out to provide the first systemic census of the food wasted in different types of food service establishments, estimate the impact of the availability of detailed waste data on the amount of food wasted, examine additional benefits, if any, from the AI/Image-classification-enabled automated data collection, and identify the mechanisms that drive the benefits of data availability and AI-enabled automation of data collection.
